# Grupo4-HC-familiar App: Huella verde
### Problem 

The central problem of this project lies in the lack of awareness and education about sustainable practices in households, which results in a high carbon footprint and little motivation to change habits. Many families, and especially children, are not sufficiently informed about how their daily actions affect the environment. This project seeks to address this urgent need through an app that tracks the family carbon footprint, offers green challenges, provides interactive education for children, and uses a reward system to motivate the adoption of sustainable practices.

### Description

This project focuses on educating and motivating families, especially those with children, to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. The app will not only seek to reduce the family carbon footprint, but also to instill sustainability values in the youngest.

Possible key features:

● Family Carbon Footprint Tracker: It will allow families to calculate their joint carbon footprint based on their energy consumption, travel, food, and shopping habits.

● Family Challenges: Weekly challenges that promote low-carbon activities, such as cooking a vegetarian meal together, car-free days, or creative recycling projects.

● Interactive Education for Kids: Interactive sections designed to teach children about sustainability and the environment through games, stories, and educational activities.

● Rewards and Achievements: Points and medals system to motivate continued participation, redeemable for rewards such as tickets to natural parks or discounts on sustainable products.

## Strategy
In the strategy part, the team made a value proposition, which helped us to take the first steps towards the solution required by our potential client. Which can be seen represented in the following image (.png in repository).

Even though we have gathered information from several points of view, one of the most important was to realize from the functionality side, that in order to be useful, the application had to generate a constant use and to address that, some strategies such as competing with yourself or others, to generate “addiction” in the users, came up.


## Scope
To define the scope we use two techniques, the Benchmark and UX Personas.

### Benchmark
With the benchmark we were able to realize the good things that the competition or the rest of the market had in order to extract the good things that they had that can bring us, in addition to delimit some things (.png in repository).

### UX Personas
In the case of UX Personas, we conducted 3 of these, with potential end users of our application (.png in repository).

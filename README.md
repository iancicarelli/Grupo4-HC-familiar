# Grupo4-HC-familiar App: Huella verde
### Problem 

The central problem of this project lies in the lack of awareness and education about sustainable practices in households, which results in a high carbon footprint and little motivation to change habits. Many families, and especially children, are not sufficiently informed about how their daily actions affect the environment. This project seeks to address this urgent need through an app that tracks the family carbon footprint, offers green challenges, provides interactive education for children, and uses a reward system to motivate the adoption of sustainable practices.

### Description

This project focuses on educating and motivating families, especially those with children, to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. The app will not only seek to reduce the family carbon footprint, but also to instill sustainability values in the youngest.

Possible key features:

● Family Carbon Footprint Tracker: It will allow families to calculate their joint carbon footprint based on their energy consumption, travel, food, and shopping habits.

● Family Challenges: Weekly challenges that promote low-carbon activities, such as cooking a vegetarian meal together, car-free days, or creative recycling projects.

● Interactive Education for Kids: Interactive sections designed to teach children about sustainability and the environment through games, stories, and educational activities.

● Rewards and Achievements: Points and medals system to motivate continued participation, redeemable for rewards such as tickets to natural parks or discounts on sustainable products.

## Strategy
In the strategy part, the team made a value proposition, which helped us to take the first steps towards the solution required by our potential client. Which can be seen represented in the following image (.png in repository).

Even though we have gathered information from several points of view, one of the most important was to realize from the functionality side, that in order to be useful, the application had to generate a constant use and to address that, some strategies such as competing with yourself or others, to generate “addiction” in the users, came up.


## Scope
To define the scope we use two techniques, the Benchmark and UX Personas.

### Benchmark
The benchmarking process for our Green Footprint app is crucial to understanding user needs. By analyzing similar products like Duolingo, EcoHero, Netflix, and NatGeo Kids, we can identify notable features and functionality that can inspire and improve our own app.

After an analysis of these products, we have recognized aspects that we can take advantage of in our project, such as the use of profiles to compare our progress with that of other users, dynamic games and a system to track the user's progress. In addition, we considered it important to include a login system with Google accounts, a carbon calculator and environmental challenges.

With the benchmark we were able to realize the good things that the competition or the rest of the market had in order to extract the good things that they had that can bring us, in addition to delimit some things.

### UX Personas
Huella Verde was designed to encourage its users, both children and adults, to improve their carbon footprint, providing an easy-to-use application that implements challenges and games in a new way to raise awareness about environmental care. Huella Verde, being an app that motivates you to set and complete daily challenges, is perfect for those who want to start helping the environment or for those who want to encourage or teach others to do so. By motivating users to improve week by week, Huella Verde promotes an environmentally friendly life for all its users, achieving a significant impact on the community.

In the case of UX Personas, we conducted 3 of these, with potential end users of our application.

## Structure
The following navigation diagram was made to show the structure of the application.

## Skeleton
After defining requirements and refining user needs, we begin wireframe design as part of The Skeleton Plane (Chapter 6, Elements of User Experience). This stage identifies key aspects of interface, navigation, and design. A mockup is then created to show how the design will communicate with the user and present information. According to the Surface Plane (Chapter 7, Elements of User Experience), wireframes guide the final user interface implementation. This phase emphasizes visual design and the final presentation, using wireframes as a foundation. Wireframes facilitate communication among designers, developers, and stakeholders, enabling discussion and validation of the layout and functionality before implementation.

## Surface
Once the wireframe is approved by design, development, and stakeholders, we can develop a high-quality interface. This stage, highlighted in the Surface Plane (Chapter 7, Elements of User Experience), focuses on how the user will feel when using the application, considering elements like contrast, color, and typography. A well-designed interface merges content, functionality, and aesthetics, representing the peak of the user experience journey. Visual design is essential here, enhancing appeal and shaping user behavior. Through strategic use of color palettes, typography, and contrast, designers create interfaces that visually captivate, convey brand identity, and facilitate user navigation.

### HIGH END INTERFACES OLD
In this section the first version of the interfaces created by our work team will be shown. These interfaces are to be taken as a reference and to be able to see the changes that were made by the work team, where we can notice the change.

Observation some of the views that are present after receiving feedback were deleted or modified

### Heuristic evaluation results
Heuristic evaluation is an essential process in application development, as it allows usability problems to be identified and corrected before end users interact with the product. In this way we were able to apply the corresponding improvements to our project.

The heuristic evaluation carried out for our project detected the following problems for correction
1. Navbar overloaded
2. Inconsistent and unintuitive icons, different dimensions.
3. As it is an application for children, the use of a co2 calculator can be very
complex for them.
4. The add button on the calculator is not easily understood, is not intuitive and does not
shows what functionality it does.
5. Unclear password recovery.
6. Upper and lower sections are not very consistent, they have different edge radii,
even in themselves.
7. There is no error handling when entering access credentials incorrectly.
8. There is a news section and another library section, which can be combined in the
same view with categories.
9. In the profile view, a three-dot icon is displayed that indicates “options”, not
These options are listed and there is also an icon of a person who is unknown
What functionality does it fulfill?
10. The points table does not show the number of points for each user
11. Information missing for reward redemption
12. There is a trophies section, which shows the trophies and medals available, but
there is no navigation to get to that view.
13. The user cannot review which trophies and medals they have obtained, nor review those of others.
people.
14. You don't capitalize the words in the daily challenge boxes.
15. Interaction with challenges unclear, does not provide information explaining how
It works, and because the challenges have that disposition.
16. Side Navbar is unnecessary, since they have one at the bottom.
17. There is no options section to configure aspects of the application such as the
language.

### Accessibility issues
For our project, we realized that we needed to implement accessibility improvements because it is essential not only to comply with laws and regulations, but also to ensure a positive user experience for everyone. Accessibility encourages inclusivity, improves usability, and can provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Integrating accessibility will ensure that our app is accessible to as many people as possible.
For usability we focus on these aspects

#### Change in buttons
In this case the initiative consists of making the application buttons generate some type of feedback for the user and they can realize that they are indeed being
pressed, it also generates a little more dynamism to the application, in the case of the image, when you press the access button, it changes to a different color tone.

#### Color palette review
In this case, due to the colors used, we believed it was pertinent to carry out a review of the colors, so that they do not generate conflicts for people with color blindness,
Using the color.adobe.com page we verify that the color palette used in the application was safe for people with color blindness, so our application does not exclude or
makes accessibility difficult for people with this condition.

#### Gender Neutral
We have decided to implement Gender Neutral standards, this helps us not assume the gender of a person and thus avoid discomfort or increase the comfort of the user when using the application.For cases of our system it is quite relevant, since it is intended for a public broad, which consists of children and adults, so using neutral language to encompass
all is essential, in this case it is shown as in the trophies part, where Some trophies and medals had very marked gender names and were quite exclusionary and changes these names to something suitable for the vast majority.

#### Lens Of Controls (interactive content)
In this case it refers to everything that the user interacts with, be it buttons, links, etc. If the elements that are going to be interacted with are very small or are on an edge, this makes it difficult for the user to interact with them, as will be shown below. continuation.If we realize it is very difficult to select a user to edit it, this is why we will implement an improvement in its size, also if it implemented an improvement in navigability along with the language used.

### HIGH END INTERFACES UPDATED
Below are the updated interfaces based on feedback from presentations, cross-evaluation and heuristics, as well as added accessibility initiatives. A complete change was made to the kit used, completely renewing the interface, solving major problems such as spacing, contrast, fonts, layout and eliminating the handmade look, one of the accessibility initiatives was to incorporate neutral gender and review the color palette with adobe color, so as not to generate difficulties for people with color blindness. From the functionality section, several were eliminated, such as libraries and rewards, to focus on games, family mode, tracking and eco tasks, while eliminating much overload on the navbar, which was balanced and introduced a different navigability in the application.

# Grupo4-HC-familiar App: Huella verde
### Problem 

The central problem of this project lies in the lack of awareness and education about sustainable practices in households, which results in a high carbon footprint and little motivation to change habits. Many families, and especially children, are not sufficiently informed about how their daily actions affect the environment. This project seeks to address this urgent need through an app that tracks the family carbon footprint, offers green challenges, provides interactive education for children, and uses a reward system to motivate the adoption of sustainable practices.

### Description

This project focuses on educating and motivating families, especially those with children, to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives. The app will not only seek to reduce the family carbon footprint, but also to instill sustainability values in the youngest.

Possible key features:

● Family Carbon Footprint Tracker: It will allow families to calculate their joint carbon footprint based on their energy consumption, travel, food, and shopping habits.

● Family Challenges: Weekly challenges that promote low-carbon activities, such as cooking a vegetarian meal together, car-free days, or creative recycling projects.

● Interactive Education for Kids: Interactive sections designed to teach children about sustainability and the environment through games, stories, and educational activities.

● Rewards and Achievements: Points and medals system to motivate continued participation, redeemable for rewards such as tickets to natural parks or discounts on sustainable products.

## Strategy
In the strategy part, the team made a value proposition, which helped us to take the first steps towards the solution required by our potential client. Which can be seen represented in the following image (.png in repository).

Even though we have gathered information from several points of view, one of the most important was to realize from the functionality side, that in order to be useful, the application had to generate a constant use and to address that, some strategies such as competing with yourself or others, to generate “addiction” in the users, came up.


## Scope
To define the scope we use two techniques, the Benchmark and UX Personas.

### Benchmark
With the benchmark we were able to realize the good things that the competition or the rest of the market had in order to extract the good things that they had that can bring us, in addition to delimit some things (.png in repository).

### UX Personas
In the case of UX Personas, we conducted 3 of these, with potential end users of our application (.png in repository).

## Structure
The following navigation diagram was made to show the structure of the application (.png in repository).

## Skeleton
After defining requirements and refining user needs, we begin wireframe design as part of The Skeleton Plane (Chapter 6, Elements of User Experience). This stage identifies key aspects of interface, navigation, and design. A mockup is then created to show how the design will communicate with the user and present information. According to the Surface Plane (Chapter 7, Elements of User Experience), wireframes guide the final user interface implementation. This phase emphasizes visual design and the final presentation, using wireframes as a foundation. Wireframes facilitate communication among designers, developers, and stakeholders, enabling discussion and validation of the layout and functionality before implementation.

PROFILE VIEWS:
In these views you can create profiles (family mode), view and edit them.

## Surface
Once the wireframe is approved by design, development, and stakeholders, we can develop a high-quality interface. This stage, highlighted in the Surface Plane (Chapter 7, Elements of User Experience), focuses on how the user will feel when using the application, considering elements like contrast, color, and typography. A well-designed interface merges content, functionality, and aesthetics, representing the peak of the user experience journey. Visual design is essential here, enhancing appeal and shaping user behavior. Through strategic use of color palettes, typography, and contrast, designers create interfaces that visually captivate, convey brand identity, and facilitate user navigation.

### HIGH END INTERFACES OLD
In this section the first version of the interfaces created by our work team will be shown. These interfaces are to be taken as a reference and to be able to see the changes that were made by the work team, where we can notice the change.

### HIGH END INTERFACES UPDATED
Below are the updated interfaces based on feedback from presentations, cross-evaluation and heuristics, as well as added accessibility initiatives. A complete change was made to the kit used, completely renewing the interface, solving major problems such as spacing, contrast, fonts, layout and eliminating the handmade look, one of the accessibility initiatives was to incorporate neutral gender and review the color palette with adobe color, so as not to generate difficulties for people with color blindness. From the functionality section, several were eliminated, such as libraries and rewards, to focus on games, family mode, tracking and eco tasks, while eliminating much overload on the navbar, which was balanced and introduced a different navigability in the application.
